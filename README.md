It includes code to:
 - examine selected files client side (name, size and type) plus show thumbnail of images
 - use a custom link (instead of standard form button) to trigger file upload window
 - sets up a basic drag and drop zone for selecting files
 - upload selected files asynchronously, including feedback display through the UI
 - includes server side code using Python & Flask
